# Single Shell Free Water Elimination Diffusion Tensor Model 

This is a Python implementation of a Single Shell Free Water Elimination Model
the follows the papers listed in the references section below. *This software
is untested so please do not use it for anything important without doing your
own testing.* 

There is a separate effort by @mvgolub and @RafaelNH to put in an expanded
single shell model into [Dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/index.html).  Please follow
along at the [Dipy Issue Tracker
#827](https://github.com/nipy/dipy/issues/827).  When the Dipy version is
ready, it is likely to be better tested, more user friendly and efficient. 


## Software requirements

* Python 3.6.3
* [Dipy](http://nipy.org/dipy/index.html) 0.14.0

## Getting Started



## Documentation

This [README](README.md) file has most of the overview of how to use this
software. The mathematics behind the implementation is written out in this [linked pdf
file](./doc/SingleShellFreeWater.pdf)
